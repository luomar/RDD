Create a new github repo named “RDD”.
 Inside the RDD directory, put all the subdirectories we’ve discussed in
 class.
 Post the link to the repo so I can see it’s done as discussed.
 Save the Hansen_dwi.dta file into your new /data subdirectory.
 Note: The outcome variable is “recidivism” or “recid” which is measuring
 whether the person showed back up in the data within 4 months.

Replication (worth 6 points).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

In the United States, an officer can arrest a driver if after giving them
 a blood alcohol content test they learn the driver had a BAC of 0.08 or
 higher.
 We will only focus on the 0.08 BAC cutoff.
 We will be ignoring the 0.15 cutoff for all this analysis.
 Create a dummy equaling 1 if bac1>= 0.08 and 0 otherwise in your do file
 or R file.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

\begin_layout Enumerate

The first thing to do in any RDD is look at the raw data and see if there’s
 any evidence for manipulation.
 If people were capable of manipulating their blood alcohol content (bac1),
 describe the test we would use to check for this.
 Now evaluate whether you see this in these data? Recreate Figure 1 using
 the bac1 variable as your measure of blood alcohol content.
 Do you find evidence for sorting on the running variable? .
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Basically we have to look for a bumps before or after the cut line that
 show manipulation.
 In the replication the value to replicate the chart is width=.0001 no width=0.001
 as showed in the paper.

Based on administrative records from the Washington State Impaired Driver
 Testing Program, 1999–2007.
 The histogram height on the vertical axis is based on frequency of obser-

 The vertical black lines represent the two legal thresh- olds at 0.08 and
 0.15.
 The bin width is 0.001, the original precision used on the breathalyzers.

Calculate the simple difference in outcomes.
 How similar is it to the ATE?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
First, I define 
\begin_inset Formula $Y^{obs}=DY^{1}+\left(1-D\right)Y^{0}$
\end_inset

 .
 Then, I estimate the SDO as the average, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{Y^{obs}}=7.5$
\end_inset

 It is not similar.
 In fact, there is a big difference between both measures.

Calculate the ATT and the ATU.
 How similar are each of these to the SDO? How similar are each of these
 to the ATE?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
So, if 
\begin_inset Formula $D=1\Rightarrow ATT=E\left[Y^{1}|D=1\right]=8$
\end_inset

 & 
\begin_inset Formula $D=0\Rightarrow ATU=E\left[Y^{0}|D=0\right]=7.1$
\end_inset

 .
 SDO is a weighted (by the treatmen) average between ATT and ATU.
 All of them are very different than ATE, they bias is evident.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Show that the SDO is numerically equal to the sum of ATE, selection bias
 and heterogeneous treatment effects bias.
 You will need to calculate the ATE, selection bias and heterogenous treatment
 effects bias, combine them in the appropriate way, and show that their
 sum is equivalent to the SDO.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
So, we have to show that if 
\begin_inset Formula $SDO=ATE+E\left[Y^{1}|D=0\right]-E\left[Y^{0}|D=0\right]+(1-\pi)(ATT-ATU)=0.9$

 Is it equal to ATE, SDO, ATT or ATU? Did controlling for age recover the

Create a separate table labeled Table 2.
 This table should have three columns.
 The first equation is the multivariate regression.
 The second equation is the auxiliary regression of D onto Age.
 The third equation regresses Y onto D ̃ which is the residual from the
 second equation.
 Compare the coefficient on D from the first equation to the coefficient
 on D ̃ in the third equation.
 What does this tell you about how to interpret multivariate regressions?
 Y_i=α+δD_i+βAge+ ε_i , later D_i=β_0+γ_1 AGE_i+ ϵ_i and finally Y_i=α+δ

This question is partly based on a 2005 article published in the Journal
 of Behavioral Medicine that claimed forgiveness improved physical health
 outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that we want to estimate the average causal effect of forgiveness
 (D) on health (Y) using observational data.
 Figure 1 represents our belief about how forgiveness and health are related
 both in the sample and outside the sample.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that forgiveness (D) causes health (Y), but we only have data
 on patients meeting with psychotherapists for mental health treatment (patients
).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individuals who are more open towards behavioral therapy in the first place
 (openness) become patients (patients).
 We believe these people are also more likely to forgive (D).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wealth is also important because wealth causes people to see a therapist
 (patients) in part because of their higher willingness to pay for future
 and present health.
 Wealth also improves health outcomes.
 Unfortunately wealth is not in your data.
 Wealth is also associated with insurance coverage, which also causes people
 see therapists (patients) and which affects health outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And remember – we only have data on patients.
 Our sample, in other words, consists only of patients.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
In this case only insurance is a backdoor, could it be wealth if we have
 the data, but assuming the dash lines that it is unobservable, it should
 be insurance that is related with patients and health.

What identification strategy would allow you to estimate the causal effect
 of forgiveness on health? Assume you aren’t limited to merely data on patients.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
I would look for a variable that is related to health and forgiveness but
 not with insurance or health.
 Something like the kind of medication prescribed, asuming that age is related
 to D, I would use age too.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

Now assume you only have data on patients.
 Assume that forgiveness is binary and you calculate the following simple
 difference in outcomes: Y=α+δD+γInsurance+ε But in this regression, you
 only use data that you have on patients.
 Will your estimate of δ identify the ATE? Why/why not? Your answer should
 indicate whether this control strategy opened up in any backdoors or closed
 any backdoors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Yes it will work because we are conditioning by the back door that we have.
 The estimation will be close to ATE.

Use Figure 2 for the following questions.
 In all four DAGs (a-d), X is a binary treatment variable and Y is the outcome
